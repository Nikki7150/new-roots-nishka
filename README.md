## Description
This is my very own website for a cause that I want to see get better. It's to make awareness to the Immigrant and First gen students difficulties as they get into high school and college. I am also an immigrant student from India and I moved to the US just last year before my junior year and I have gone through and I know the difficulties new students face when joining for the first time or in the middle of high school, much like I did. I linked all the resources that I used and some others I got from research so as to help students excel. 
It is not connected or affiliated with any other websites or people. I just made it for the Girls Who Code pathways program. 
### update
I have connected many other websites on the resources tab of this website. It is still made just as a side project so it shows that you are signing up for the letter, but really, you are not. It is just some customizable text made as per the GWC course. 

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to Run

1.  **Unzip the file:** Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a local folder on your computer.
2.  **Open with a browser:** Navigate to the project folder, locate the `index.html` file, and double-click it. This will open the project in your default web browser.

3.  After doing this, the program should work. If it doesnt, I am really sorry. You can email me just in case if I havent emailed you. I will be emailing a video live demo of the website. Since i made this in replit, I couldnt deploy it into the internet. You can also check it out in my github page i pasted in the comments in the google form as well as the replit link in the comments.

## How I made this project
I made this project first as a part of the GWC program. This free woman-led program teaches girls to code from square one and advance from there. I followed through this program and this website was made as a part of it. After the program finished, I found out about Athena Awards Hackclub and I joined it because I was interested in making more projects on my own. I then took this website and added more features, debugged code, and also asked AI for both inspiration and some debugging tips. I also used AI to learn how to add more advanced elements like the hamburger navigation bar when the website is used on a mobile, the resource cards animation when user hovers over it, and even more debugging after adding these advanced code. I tried my best to debug as much as i could but some bugs werent getting fixed so i had to ask ai, but i learnt from my mistakes. 

I struggled a lot with the bugs and also running the code since i moved this website from replit to codespaces to use Wakatime. I was so used to replit and its debugging tools that i didnt really know how to debug properly on codespaces. I am also using my school controlled Chromebook to  make this website so i didnt have the liberty of using the "inspect" web browser debugging tool to my advantage. But i made the best of it and debugged a lot on my own. When i came across bugs that didnt make sense or were just not debugging, I resorted to using AI for help. But i did make it a point to try and atleast understand what AI did to helo debug the code and learnt something new. 
I spent 4.25 hours approx when the website was on replit and I was making it for GWC. Then I spent 4 hours approx after I moved it to codespaces and added more stuff for athena. Overall, it took me almost 8.25 hours to make it.
