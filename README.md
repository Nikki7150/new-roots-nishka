# New Roots Activist Website - Web Development and design course 

## Description
This is my very own website for a cause that I want to see get better. It's to make awareness to the Immigrant and First gen students difficulties as they get into high school and college. It is not connected or affiliated with any other websites or people. I just made it for my Girls Who Code program. 
### update
I have connected many other websites on the resources tab of this website. It is still made just as a side project so it shows that you are signing up for the letter, but really, you are not. It is just some customizable text made as per the GWC course. 

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to Run

1.  **Unzip the file:** Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a local folder on your computer.
2.  **Open with a browser:** Navigate to the project folder, locate the `index.html` file, and double-click it. This will open the project in your default web browser.

3.  After doing this, the program should work. If it doesnt, I am really sorry. You can email me just in case if I havent emailed you. I will be emailing a video live demo of the website. Since i made this in replit, I couldnt deploy it into the internet. You can also check it out in my github page i pasted in the comments in the google form as well as the replit link in the comments.
